### Features Implemented
- Client-side filtering with React state management
- Real-time filtering updates
- Proper image loading with error handling
- Additional image gallery functionality
- Brand and category badges
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## 5. Navigation and Routing

### Implementation Details
- Created shared Navigation component
- Implemented client-side navigation with Next.js Link
- Added active state highlighting for current page
- Integrated navigation into root layout for consistency

## 6. Styling and UI/UX

### Design System
- Consistent color palette using Tailwind CSS
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Hover effects and transitions for interactive elements
- Proper spacing and typography hierarchy
- Card-based design with shadows and rounded corners

### Components Styled
- Header with logo and navigation
- Product cards with image, description, and pricing
- Filtering controls with proper labeling
- Statistics display with visual hierarchy
- Footer with multiple columns of information

## 7. Data Handling

### CSV Parsing
- Custom CSV parsing function to handle quoted fields
- Proper handling of comma-separated values within fields
- Data validation and error handling

### Price Formatting
- Implementation of Guarani (₲) currency formatting
- Proper thousands separators
- Removal of decimal places for cleaner display

### Image Management
- Creation of symbolic link for images directory in public folder
- Proper image paths for both main products and brand products
- Error handling for missing images with fallback content

## 8. Performance Optimizations

### Techniques Used
- Server-side rendering for initial page load
- Client-side filtering for interactive experience
- Image optimization through Next.js image handling
- Code splitting through Next.js dynamic imports
- Proper React component structure for reusability
- Pagination for handling large datasets
- Loading states with skeleton screens
- Memoization for expensive calculations

### Pagination Implementation
- Server-side pagination for initial data loading
- Client-side filtering with pagination awareness
- Efficient pagination controls with:
  - Previous/Next buttons
  - Page number display
  - Ellipsis for large page sets
  - Current page highlighting
- Configurable page size (default 12 products per page)

### Loading States
- Skeleton loading screens for better perceived performance
- Component-level loading states
- Smooth transitions between loading and loaded states

### Virtualized Rendering
- Efficient rendering of large datasets
- Only rendering visible items in the viewport
- Reducing DOM overhead for better performance
- Smooth scrolling experience even with thousands of products

## 9. Testing Process

### Verification Steps
- Checked that all pages load correctly
- Verified that product data displays properly
- Tested filtering functionality on brands page
- Confirmed image loading and error handling
- Validated responsive design on different screen sizes
- Tested pagination with different page sizes
- Verified loading states display correctly
- Tested performance with large datasets (1000+ products)
